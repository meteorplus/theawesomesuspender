# ðŸ˜Ž The Awesome Suspender

### Read this if you have lost tabs from your browser

I have written a guide for how to recover your lost tabs here: https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526

Please contribute if you have any extra insight on alternative methods for tab recovery.

### Welcome

"The Awesome Suspender" is a free and open-source Google Chrome extension for people who find that chrome is consuming too much system resource or suffer from frequent chrome crashing. Once installed and enabled, this extension will automatically *suspend* tabs that have not been used for a while, freeing up memory and cpu that the tab was consuming.

If you have suggestions or problems using the extension, please [submit a bug or a feature request](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/).

### Chrome Web Store

The Awesome Suspender is also [available via the official Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg).

Please note that the webstore version may be significantly behind the latest version here. That is because I try to keep webstore updates down to a minimum due to their [disruptive effect](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526).

For more information on the permissions required for the extension, please refer to this gitHub issue: (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/213)

### Install as an extension from source

1. Download the **[latest available version](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/releases)** and unarchive to your preferred location (whichever suits you).
2. Using **Google Chrome** browser, navigate to chrome://extensions/ and enable "Developer mode" in the upper right corner.
3. Click on the <kbd>Load unpacked extension...</kbd> button.
4. Browse to the src directory of the downloaded, unarchived release and confirm.

If you have completed the above steps, the "welcome" page will open indicating successful installation of the extension.
